### Scale

In the chapters to come there will be different rules to follow depending on how many nodes are visible and how big these nodes are. For naming conventions we’re using *small*, *medium* and *large scale*, in a similar manner as used for geographical maps:
* **Large scale** You’re up close to the graph, the nodes will be very big and most likely you would only be able to see a few handful or dozen on your screen. You’re focusing mostly on the exact relationships between the nodes then the structure of the graph in itself.
* **Medium scale** The intermediary scale where you can still distinguish details on the nodes, but you can also see some graph structure such as clusters. This scale happens somewhere along the lines of several dozen nodes up till ±a hundred nodes on a typical screen.
* **Small scale** You’re looking at many many nodes at once, hundreds, thousands or even more. The nodes are very small and it’s difficult to make out details on the nodes, but this view gives you a great way to look at the structural overview of your graph.
