### HEM Scale Units

A \`hem\` is a hex-grid measurement unit for graph structures, inspired by typographic \`em\` units and equal to the current
\`em\` size specified for captions.

Graph visualization can be scaled to show more nodes at smaller scale, or fewer nodes at large scale. Relatively bigger or smaller
node size is easy to understand.
