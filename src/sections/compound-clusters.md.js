## Clusters

A collection of nodes and relationships grouped by structure into neighborhoods. Groups of nodes that are highly interconnected, and less connected to other nodes, can be grouped into a cluster. This might happen if we look at the cast of the Harry Potter movies, who have worked together for 8 movies, but most have not worked on many other movies. Therefore, the cast of Harry Potter will be heavily interconnected and could be combined into a cluster (and collapsed to look like a cluster node).

Appearance of a cluster:
* Expanded, individual node and relationships can be viewed. Representation of cluster membership varies with scale:
  * At very large scale (hem scale above hem scale 7): you are so far zoomed in that you are looking only/inside of the cluster. There is no need for a visual distinction of the cluster itself anymore.
  * At medium & large scale (hem scale between 3 and 5): combines the visual appearance of aggregate nodes and sections: Has a double stroke running around all cluster member nodes (with transparency in between the two strokes)
  * At small scale (below hem scale 1): node fill color is preferred for identifying cluster membership

  ![Clusters at different scales](${require('../images/compound-clusters-1.png')})

* Collapsed, appears as a single node. Visually the same as the representation of an aggregate node
  * Note however aggregate nodes are distinct from collapsed cluster nodes. Aggregate nodes are only useful in its collapsed state. The expanded state has no extra meaning, itâ€™s just the normal nodes and relationships, whereas an expanded cluster node (into its underlying nodes and relationships) would still be seen as a structural cluster.
